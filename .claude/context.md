## 🎯 Project DNA
**Type**: Jenova Engine Darwin ARM64 Port + Ultra-Focused 3D Optimization  
**Original**: [Jenova Framework](https://github.com/Jenova-Framework/J.E.N.O.V.A) (Windows/Linux-first) → Darwin ARM64 Exclusive  
**Architecture**: Jenova C++ Scripting + Metal Forward+ + SwiftUI Integration  
**Platforms**: Darwin ARM64 EXCLUSIVE (Jenova "MacOS support not planned" → WE ARE THE MACOS PORT)  
**Design Language**: Ultra-focused 3D engine, Forward+ only, SwiftUI-ready  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Jenova Porting + Engine Stripping  
**Build Status**: PORTING IN PROGRESS (120MB → <60MB target, Jenova C++ scripting integration)  

## 🧠 Core Architecture Decisions Made
```
DECISION_LOG:

[CRITICAL] - Foundation APIs exclusive (replace Jenova Windows/Linux abstractions)
[CRITICAL] - Metal-exclusive rendering (remove OpenGL/Vulkan, Forward+ only)
[CRITICAL] - Core Audio exclusive (replace cross-platform audio)
[CRITICAL] - Engine stripping: Remove 2D renderer, UI system, canvas, compatibility renderers
[Performance] - <60MB framework target (50%+ reduction from 120MB)
[Performance] - 120+ FPS Forward+ rendering target
